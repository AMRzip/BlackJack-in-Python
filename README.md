1. The game starts with a player and a dealer.

4. The goal is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
5. If the player's hand exceeds 21, they bust and lose the bet.
6. The dealer must hit until their hand value is 17 or higher.
7. The winner is determined by who has the hand value closest to 21 without exceeding it.
